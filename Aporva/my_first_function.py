# structural -> in which we don't implement any functionaliity, we just code what we have to do wtithout putting things as a block.

# functional -> in functional type of writing programs means we have better control over the code and we can use same code again and again without writing it multiple times

# object oriented

# I have to write a programs which will take two number and then add them as well as multiply them and then print them.
