# very basic for loops

# Why to learn for loop?
# When you know how number times a loop should run then we use for loop


# num=0
# while num < 10:
# 	print(num)
# 	num += 1


# let talk about range
# range(starting point, ending point + 1, skipped)

# increment = -1
# # the number of data which will be skipped will eb 2-1 => 1

# rng = range(100, 10, increment)

# for i in rng:
# 	print(i)

# lst = ["Humming bird", "beaver bird", 'raven', "Java Maina", "Conure"]

# lst2 = ("Pigeon", "Crane", "Flamingo", "Kivy")

# for bird in lst:
# 	print(f"Hello {bird} good evening.")

# print("I bought few new birds -")

# for new_bird in lst2:
# 	lst.append(new_bird)

# print(lst)

# # bird1 = "Humming bird"
# # bird2 = "Kivy"
# # bird3 = "Flamingo"

# for i in "Anurag Pandey":
# 	print(i)
