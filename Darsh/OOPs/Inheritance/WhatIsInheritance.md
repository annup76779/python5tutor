#### What is inheritance?
- A class is the structure or blueprint of an object
  - if we are making a chair, class defines what features and components/ attributes of a chair are
- and an object is the physical implementation of the structure defined in the class
  - if you put all the features and component/attributes of a chair physically together, it will make a real chair


##### Let's understand with example 
- What are the basic features of a chair?
```
