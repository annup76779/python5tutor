# what is the meaning of datatype?
# datatype are nothing but they are the types of data on which python can operate

# There are basically 4 type of data present in python:
# 1. integer --for humans its is a number
# 2. floating point --for humans it is decimal number Eg. 7.8
# 3. string --for humans any kind of work of symbol or sentence or alphabet
# 4. boolean --for python and human it is just True or False


# num1 = 56
# num2 = 34

# # addition
# num3 = num1 + num2
# print(num3)

# # multiplication
# num4 = num1 * num2
# print(num4)

#-------------
# String(used as text holding datatype)
#-------------
# we use string when we have any text which has meaning for human beings but not for our program are placed in string datatype.
# v = "Hey this is Tuesday today."
# print(v)

# my_first_name = "Anruag"
# my_second_name = "Pandey"

# my_full_name = my_first_name + " " + my_second_name
# print(my_full_name)
# print((my_full_name+", ") * 10)

# we cannont do any calculation on string 
# so how is this possible that we can add and multiply strings
# strings can never ever be modified. If you have to modify then the only way is to make a new string

# add and multipling a string is not any calcultion but it is just making a new string with some modification and this is called
# concatination of string 

# # so basically when we add two string, what we are doing is we are making new string with the second string into the first string.
# k = "Hello"
# b = k + " k "
# print(b)


# so what happens when you multiply a string
# the same string get copied for the same number of time and a new string is made with all the copies in it
# print(b * 10)


i_have = 200
shoping_costs = 250
