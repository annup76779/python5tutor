# Rules of naming things in python
# 1. any name cannot start with any digit
# Eg. n5ame x         name5

# 2. any name should not have any space in it
# eg. first name = "Anruag"  x
#     first_name = "Anurag" 

# 3. any name must not have any symbol other than '_' underscore
# eg. dollar = "$"

# convention  -> PEP7
# any variable name should be named with all capital letter if it is holding any constant in it.
# max_len = 12
# MAX_LEN = 12


first_name = "Anurag Pandey" # variable
PI = 22/7 # denoting constant
MAX_LEN = 24 # denoting constant



print(first_name)
print(PI)
print(MAX_LEN)
