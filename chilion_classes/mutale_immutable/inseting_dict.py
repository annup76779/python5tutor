# the first this - 

# our dictionary 
mydict = {"name": "Anurag Pandey", "email": "annup76779@gmail.com", "phone": "+91 8726771497", "state": "India", "state": "Singapore"}

#-----------------------------
# Insertion to the dictionary #
# -----------------------------
# to insert something to the dictionary we have to simply wrtie the key and give it a value as follow: -
mydict["city"] = "Pratapgarh"
print(mydict)



#-----------------------------
# changing value of the dictionary #
# -----------------------------

mydict["city"] = "Agra"
print(mydict)

# here we can see that process of changing the value of a key and creating a new key: value pair is exactly same

# then we need to take care about few things ------
# 1. if we are creating a new key: value pair then the key must be unique.
# 2. if you are changing something then keep in mind that what key you want to change, i.e. you should now use a unique key.
